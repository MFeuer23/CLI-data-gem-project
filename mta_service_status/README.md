# MtaServiceStatus

This is a CLI gem that can show you the general status of the MTA, as well as a more detailed status for a particular train line.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mta_service_status'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mta_service_status

## Usage

Use this handy gem to check the status of the MTA service. Type ./bin/mta-service-status into your terminal to run the CLI. You will be prompted to enter "status" to show the general status, or a train line for more details about a particular train, or exit.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
